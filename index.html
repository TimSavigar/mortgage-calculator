    <h2>Understanding mortgage calculations</h2>
    <p>A mortgage payment is determined by three key factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal</strong> – the amount you borrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest rate</strong> – the annual percentage charged on your outstanding balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Term</strong> – the length of time over which you repay the loan.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our calculator uses the standard amortisation formula to compute a fixed monthly payment. Rates can vary widely between lenders and may be fixed or variable, so always compare offers and seek professional advice.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Loan Amortisation and Repayment Strategies</h2>
        <p>Loan amortisation is the process of paying off debt over time through regular payments that cover both principal and interest. Understanding how amortisation works helps you make informed decisions about borrowing, refinancing, and debt management strategies.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Components of Loan Amortisation</h3>
        <p><strong>Principal:</strong></p>
        <p>The principal is the original amount borrowed. Each payment reduces the principal balance, which in turn reduces the amount of interest charged on the remaining balance. In the early years of a loan, most of your payment goes toward interest, while in later years, more goes toward reducing the principal.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Interest Rate:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Rate:</strong> Interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term</li>
            <li><strong>Variable Rate:</strong> Interest rate can change based on market conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</strong> Includes interest plus fees and other costs</li>
            <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> Interest is calculated on both principal and previously accrued interest</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Loan Term:</strong></p>
        <p>The term is the length of time over which you agree to repay the loan. Longer terms result in lower monthly payments but higher total interest costs, while shorter terms have higher monthly payments but lower total costs.</p>

        <h3>How Amortisation Works</h3>
        <p><strong>The Amortisation Formula:</strong></p>
        <p>The standard formula for calculating fixed monthly payments is:</p>
        <p><em>M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]</em></p>
        <p>Where: M = Monthly payment, P = Principal, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Number of payments</p>
        
        <p><strong>Payment Breakdown Over Time:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Payments:</strong> Mostly interest, small principal reduction</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Payments:</strong> Gradually more principal, less interest</li>
            <li><strong>Final Payments:</strong> Mostly principal, minimal interest</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Amortisation Schedule:</strong></p>
        <p>An amortisation schedule shows the breakdown of each payment, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment number and date</li>
            <li>Total payment amount</li>
            <li>Principal portion of payment</li>
            <li>Interest portion of payment</li>
            <li>Remaining balance after payment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Loans and Their Characteristics</h3>
        <p><strong>Mortgages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically 15-30 year terms</li>
            <li>Secured by real estate</li>
            <li>Generally lower interest rates than unsecured loans</li>
            <li>May have fixed or adjustable rates</li>
            <li>Often include property taxes and insurance in payments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Personal Loans:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually 1-7 year terms</li>
            <li>Unsecured (no collateral required)</li>
            <li>Higher interest rates than secured loans</li>
            <li>Fixed monthly payments</li>
            <li>Used for various purposes (debt consolidation, major purchases)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Auto Loans:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically 3-7 year terms</li>
            <li>Secured by the vehicle</li>
            <li>Interest rates vary by credit score and vehicle age</li>
            <li>May include gap insurance and extended warranties</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategies for Reducing Loan Costs</h3>
        <p><strong>Making Extra Payments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principal-Only Payments:</strong> Apply extra money directly to principal</li>
            <li><strong>Bi-weekly Payments:</strong> Make half-payments every two weeks (26 payments per year)</li>
            <li><strong>Lump Sum Payments:</strong> Use bonuses, tax refunds, or windfalls to reduce principal</li>
            <li><strong>Round Up Payments:</strong> Pay slightly more than the minimum each month</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Refinancing Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Interest Rate:</strong> Can reduce monthly payments or shorten term</li>
            <li><strong>Shorter Term:</strong> Pay off loan faster with higher monthly payments</li>
            <li><strong>Cash-Out Refinancing:</strong> Borrow against equity for other purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Costs vs. Benefits:</strong> Consider closing costs and fees</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Factors That Affect Loan Terms</h3>
        <p><strong>Credit Score:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher scores typically qualify for lower interest rates</li>
            <li>Affects loan approval and terms offered</li>
            <li>Can be improved over time with responsible credit management</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lenders prefer ratios below 36-43%</li>
            <li>Includes all monthly debt payments relative to income</li>
            <li>Lower ratios may qualify for better terms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Down Payment (for mortgages):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Larger down payments reduce loan amount and monthly payments</li>
            <li>May eliminate need for private mortgage insurance (PMI)</li>
            <li>Can qualify for better interest rates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Loan Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focusing Only on Monthly Payment:</strong> Consider total cost over loan term</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring Fees and Closing Costs:</strong> Factor in all associated expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Not Shopping Around:</strong> Compare offers from multiple lenders</li>
            <li><strong>Borrowing More Than Needed:</strong> Only borrow what you can comfortably afford</li>
            <li><strong>Not Reading Loan Terms:</strong> Understand all conditions and penalties</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring Prepayment Options:</strong> Know if you can make extra payments without penalty</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to Seek Professional Advice</h3>
        <p><strong>Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor When:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have complex financial situations or multiple debts</li>
            <li>You're considering refinancing or debt consolidation</li>
            <li>You need help understanding loan terms and options</li>
            <li>You're planning major financial decisions (buying a home, starting a business)</li>
            <li>You want to optimise your debt repayment strategy</li>
        </ul>
